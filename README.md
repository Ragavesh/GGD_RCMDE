</t>GGD-RCMDE<t>

A novel entropy-based feature space is proposed to extract the features from vibration signals. DE proposed by Rostaghi and Azami [1] is used as the building block with the new mapping method to formulate a Generalized Gaussian Distribution - Dispersion Entropy (GGD-DE) method, this further used in developing a novel GGD-RCMDE method.
